Even if we want to reuse the same View in one Activity with different styles we can set a theme as an attribute ([Theme overlays]( https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/android-styling-themes-overlay-1ffd57745207))

## General
### Goal
- Show skills / quality
- Get links / traffic

### Todo list
- Conjure design?
- Actual content
- Review source code
- Host on GitHub - (link back in the Readme.md to this article)

## Introduction
- "In this post I will guide you through the process of deciding how best to create the views you want in Android". Do you really do that?
- I would probably list the other headlines here with one sentence what the reader can expect from each chapter.

## Styling a View
- "Pressed, Focused, Hovered, Selected, Checkable, Checked, Activated and Window Focused" Are they documented somewhere? Can we link to it?

## Writing a Compound View
- 

## Extending a View
- Your first paragraph is not right. In different Apps (even Activities) we can use different Styles and Themes. Even if we want to reuse the same View in one Activity with different styles we can set a theme as an attribute ([Theme overlays]( https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/android-styling-themes-overlay-1ffd57745207))

- "However there is a more elegant solution here. We simply extend TextView directly." - if there is a better way why do you show the other in the first place?
	
	
## Extending View directly
- Aura video: remove status and navigation bar
- Why postInvalidate()
	
	
## Going further with SurfaceView and GLSurfaceView

- I miss a comment that you can render to a SurfaceView off the UI thread

## Summary
Can you sum up when you would recommend each approach?
